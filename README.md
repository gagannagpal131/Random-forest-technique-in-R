# Random-forest-technique-in-R
Implementation of Machine learning in R, using random forest technique to perform predictive analysis of data.

I have used a dataset "sleepstudy" to implement machine learning.I've divided the dataset into two parts:- test and train.Train dataset is used to implement the random forest technique and the test dataset is used to perform predictive analysis on the data. A comparison between the actual values and the predicted values is done along with the calculation of mean absolute percentage error between them.

Note :- Before the execution of the code, the package "randomForest" needs to be installed.
